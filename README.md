# The Fil memory profiler for Python

Fil a memory profiler designed for data processing applications.

Your code reads some data, processes it, andâ€”uses too much memory.
What you need to reduce is _peak_ memory usage.

And that's exactly what Fil will help you find: exactly which code was responsible for allocating memory at _peak_ memory usage.

To install:

```
$ pip install filprofiler
```

To use, instead of doing:

```
$ python yourscript.py --input-file=yourfile
```

Just do:

```
$ fil-profile yourscript.py --input-file=yourfile
```
